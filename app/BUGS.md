## b/00001 Unable to link JS and CSS together.

I found this amazing code online which I'm trying to link into my app.
My JS foo and understanding of `express` is too poor for me to fix this.

Bubble test code <div> is in / already: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/A6h3mrmQxUdwahv
but the linked CSSs dont work. I've added
* 1 SCSS: `src/scss/main.scss`
* 1 JS: `public/js/bubble.js`

  copied from [this article](https://www.humaan.com/blog/creating-comic-book-speech-bubbles-with-svg-and-javascript/) which points to [this JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/paulhumaan/3tjaf0yL/136/) which Im trying to replicate.

Currently I dont know how to link them. Tried both in `bin/www` and in `app.js` (and CSSs in `views/layout.pug`).
They've all failed.

GThanks to whomever wants to help!

# b/0001 everytime I use skaffold to deploy to Cloud Run I lose the `allUsers` invoker part

It seems that every time I call the `skaffold run -p wietse` it gets reset.
Also it looks like I lose track of revisions. It seems to me that Cloud Run
deployer from Skaffold DELETES and RECREATES the endpoint all the time.

I wonder if it would be possible to just keep the same endpoint (if it exists) and add a revision to it.
Not sure if it is even possible, but it would definitely provide a better experience.

See my ~5th deployment: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/4YmZAS2w9LvPc8Q it seems like the first.
